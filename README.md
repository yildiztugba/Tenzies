## Tenzies

The idea is to roll ten dice in the same.
- In the game, you can click a dice and hold it in green. 
- Then rolling with the button will not change the held dice(number)
- You try to finish the game until all of the dice are the same number by rolling dices
- As soon as we hold the last dice, the game will notice that the Numbers are all the same, and confetti will appear. 
- The button will change to "Reset Game" from "Roll"
- You can start a new game again
